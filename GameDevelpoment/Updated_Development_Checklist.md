# Development Checklist — Updated Audit
**Project:** Meme Online Battle Arena (MOBA)
**Date:** 2025-08-17 (Post-Comprehensive Audit)
**Engine/Editor:** Unity 6000.1.15f1
**Networking:** NGO 2.4.4 (server authoritative)
**Status:** Prototype - Architecture Complete, Content Implementation Needed

---

## ✅ Completed
- Core **movement system** (jump, double-jump, air control)
- **Server-authoritative damage** with friendly-fire enforcement
- **ProjectileServer / MeleeWeaponServer** updated with team logic
- **CrowdControlServer** (knockback, root, stun)
- **AIController** with FSM + Behavior Tree integration
- **AISpawnerManager** with respawn/death hook
- **Camera prototype** (Pokemon Unite-style with dynamic limited view)
- **Prefab pass** (scripts wired, AI prefabs registered with NetworkManager)
- **Compile errors resolved** — build compiles clean
- **Networking hooks** in combat, AI, CC

---

## ⚠️ In Progress
- Camera **dynamic viewport limits** (prototype working, needs polish)
- AI **state debug color feedback** (currently via material swap in network listener)
- Prefab **auditing** — AI_Sentinel prefab exists, needs AISpawnerManager assignment verification
- **Inspector setup** reminders (Team components, Blackboard defaults)
- **Layer Constants Fix** — ProjectConstants.cs layers don't match TagManager.asset
- **Match End Logic** — MatchManager timer works but missing overtime/winner logic

---

## ⏳ Pending - HIGH PRIORITY
- **Character Implementation** — GDD-specified stats for Elom Nusk, Doge Dog, Tronald Dump
- **Health System Consolidation** — Multiple health classes need standardization 
- **Input System Integration** — Verify PlayerController uses InputActionAsset actions
- **Team System Standardization** — Multiple team implementations need consolidation
## ⏳ Pending - MEDIUM PRIORITY
- Animation event alignment for melee hit windows
- VFX/audio pooling system (budget: ≤ 1 KB/frame GC)
- Full **map prefab integration** (spawn points, deposit goals)
- **Behavior Tree Logic** — Currently placeholder, needs perception/decision implementation
- **UI Integration** — Health bars, coin counters, match timer display

---

## ⏳ Pending - LOWER PRIORITY  
- Thermal/network stress test on mobile hardware
- Lobby/matchmaking (stub only)
- UI/UX polish (results screen refinement)
- Performance profiling and GC optimization

---

## ❌ Not Yet Started
- Cosmetic systems (skins, meme cosmetics)
- Player progression/meta loop
- Store/economy integration
- Localization
- Analytics/telemetry

---

## Notes
- **CRITICAL**: AI_Sentinel prefab exists but AISpawnerManager inspector assignment needs verification
- **CRITICAL**: ProjectConstants.cs layer indices (Environment=6, Player=7, AI=8, Projectile=9) don't match TagManager.asset (Environment=3, Player=6, Enemy=7, AI=8, Projectiles=9)
- **IMPORTANT**: Multiple health systems present (NetworkHealth, HealthServer, HealthNetwork) - need consolidation
- **IMPORTANT**: Character stat differentiation not yet implemented despite GDD specifications
- Ensure **Team component** exists on all players and AI, synced server-side
- Network tick: 20–30 Hz transforms, < 25 kB/s per client average
- GC allocations monitored; pooling required for skills/VFX
- Follow **performance budgets** from Executive Concept
- **Architecture Quality**: Excellent server-authoritative implementation with proper networking patterns
