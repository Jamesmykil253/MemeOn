Title: Meme Online Battle Arena (MOBA) — dark/ironic comedic 3D platformer MOBA with jumping/double-jumping.
High-level proposition: A fast‑tempo, skill‑based asymmetric arena where three‑minute and five‑minute rounds of 3v3 arena combat emphasize mobility (jump/double jump), short‑duration objective control, econ pickups (crypto coin tokens), and humorous, memetic characters (Elom Nusk, Doge Dog, Tronald Dump). The prototype priority is the 5‑minute 3v3 mode with deterministic mechanics for rapid iteration and AI‑driven bots.
Core pillars
	1	Mechanical clarity: crisp movement (ground, jump, double jump), hit registration, short cooldowns.
	2	Competitive parity: symmetric maps + asymmetric kits via balanced stats.
	3	Comedy & identity: memetic design and audio/visual gags that don’t compromise telegraphing.
	4	Network determinism & rollback-friendly state: authoritative server using Netcode for GameObjects as primary reference.
Constraints / Non‑functional requirements
	•	Use Unity Editor 60001.4f (project baseline).
	•	Use: Input System 1.14.2; AI Navigation 2.0.8; Netcode for GameObjects 2.4.4; Unity Physics 1.3.14. Design must conform to these packages’ APIs and limitations. Unity User Manual+1Unity DocumentationUnity Discussions
